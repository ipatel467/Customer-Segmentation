# Customer-Segmentation
Customer Segmentation Using Machine Learning

This is a dataset that I found on Kaggle.com. I will try to use unsupervised learning to break up the customer population into different clusters. I will be using the K-Means Algorithm for Clustering. This is also my first attempt at making an Unsupervised Learning Model. Wish me Luck!
